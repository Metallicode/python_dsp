hello everyone, this is the second video I am making on this topic, ill put a link for the first 
one in the comments. 
so this time we will continue our journey of learning to use python for creative audio processing.
the topics I will be covering today are:
- Complex Waveforms (Basically mixing 2 or more signals)
- Binaural beats (we will write a powerful short script capable of generating binaural beats style  audio files, based on our choice of fundamental freq + desired brain wave pattern.
- We will see that mixing signals can result in combined amplitude output levels, which if left unattended will result in digital distortion. I will show you how to work around this problem by 
setting different amplitudes to each component signal, allowing their amplitude sum to stay within a range of -1 and 1 values.
- we will see also how to normalize our signals for an easier approach to this problem.
- after this, we will see a simple cluster generator - this is a very nice concept of potting hundreds or more detuned signals and playing with the result.
- this will be a good place to mention FastFouriTransform and implement a simple FFT analyzer.
- next, I will go on with a general idea of tone perception, and how harmonically aligned components result in a perceived "oneness" and each component is perceived as a "overtone" of a fondemental freq, vs the perception of a fragmented set of intervals, when generating a non-harminic set of components. 
- after this we will write a script capable of generating "string-like" tones, using a simple harmonic series of frequencies, and setting their amplitude with a couple of slop functions. this will give us a very powerful synthesizer, which we will refactor again to create a Wavetable synthesizer.
- and last will be a nice concept I'm working on; the abstract is to analyze an audio sample with FFT, get a list of components, and regenerate them using our wavetable synthesizer. this will be an experimental tool that I'm sure you will love to try out and use.
so before we start I want to encourage you to pull this git repo from my Github so you will have all the code I will be writing.
